# Validation status

Version: 0.1.3. Date: 2026-09-02.

## Automated checks

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v` | 31 tests passed on Python 3.12.11 / macOS. |
| `python3 -B scripts/check_package.py` | Passed: required resources, local links, Python/JSON syntax, and the package's narrow portability checks. |
| Codex `skill-creator` bundled `quick_validate.py` | Passed: `Skill is valid!` |
| `agents/openai.yaml` | Unchanged from the parsed and length-checked 0.1.1 version. |
| Retained upstream MIT notice | Unchanged from 0.1.1, which was byte-identical to the reviewed upstream license. |

The unit tests use isolated temporary directories and cover new records,
English/Simplified/Traditional Chinese, all engineering levels, idempotency,
byte preservation, existing plans, malformed markers, unsafe roots, symlinks,
changed files, permission preservation, and partial failure reporting.
The 0.1.1 regression additionally checks that replacing legacy managed rules
preserves the existing plan and unrelated instruction bytes, then becomes a
no-op on a repeated run.

The package's own tests and helpers use only the standard library. The separate
bundled Codex validator needed PyYAML, which was supplied in an isolated tool
environment rather than added as a runtime dependency of this skill.

## Version 0.1.3: bilingual publication preparation

Added a complete Simplified Chinese README with reciprocal language links.
Both versions cover the same workflow, familiar sidebar-agent terminology,
installation, project placement, permissions, limitations, validation and
attribution. The package checker now requires both README files. The skill's
runtime instructions, record-writing helper and localized templates are unchanged
from 0.1.2. The 31 file-operation tests, structural checker and bundled skill
validator were rerun successfully; no new live-agent evaluation is claimed.

The publication candidate was reviewed as an explicit allowlist of 18 regular
text files. Source and Git-index checks found no recognized credential formats,
credential assignments, personal host paths or private runtime thread IDs.
Credential-related wording was reviewed as safety guidance, not actual values.
The only packaged agent configuration is UI metadata containing a display name
and short description; it contains no authentication or provider settings.

No environment files, private-key files, credential configuration, local task
bindings, media, cached bytecode or old distribution archives are staged.
Environment-file ignore rules supplement the explicit file selection; ignoring
a file is not treated as proof that an already tracked file is safe.

This is scoped source/index review and signature checking, not a guarantee that
every possible secret format can be detected or a comprehensive security audit.
The repository starts with a new history containing only the reviewed files.

## Version 0.1.2: terminology clarification with the familiar name retained

The skill and public documentation retain **sidebar agent / 侧边栏代理 /
側邊欄代理** as supported user-facing names and pair them with independent task
threads on first explanation. Cross-task collaboration and cross-thread
orchestration describe the workflow, not an official feature or agent type.
Native subagents can also use threads; the distinction is the verified task
operations, not screen position or an assumed parent/child hierarchy.

This is an instruction/documentation-only revision. Executable helpers, generated
record templates, UI metadata, resource paths, and the project-placement policy
remain unchanged. Comparison against the previous archive found no unrelated
source changes. Both earlier release archives are retained.

The 31 existing file-operation tests, package structural checker, and bundled
skill validator were rerun successfully. The bundled validator ran through
`uv run --no-project --with PyYAML python -B`; plain Python did not have PyYAML.
The skill itself still has no new runtime dependency.

Two raw behavioral scenarios were added: a terminology-only Chinese discussion,
and an explicit request to create project-scoped sidebar agents when both task
and native-subagent tools exist. Their review criteria cover retaining the name,
avoiding unrequested setup, and selecting independent tasks without a custom
section. These new scenarios have not been run in independent agent contexts or
against a live app; adding them is not a behavioral pass claim. The older probe
results below remain historical results for their stated versions.

## Version 0.1.1: project-placement correction

Real use of 0.1.0 exposed a routing failure: tasks were bound to the correct
saved project, but an unsolicited custom sidebar section was also created and
passed to the delegated commander as the desired team location. A review of
the reported conversation established the extra section-creation and regrouping
calls; the same conversation later corrected its team placement. No existing
team or project was mutated during this skill update.

The correction separates project membership, execution location, and sidebar
organization. Project teams now default to the verified project's normal
grouping, including a newly delegated commander. Explicit custom-section
requests remain supported. Missing saved-project registration is a prerequisite,
not a reason to create projectless tasks or a substitute section. The English,
Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese record templates carry the policy.

Three new raw cases cover default project placement, an explicitly requested
custom section, and an unregistered current directory. Each was evaluated in a
fresh agent context with only the skill and that case, not the review rubric or
prior conclusions. The integrator read all three reports and intended calls:

- Default: used the verified project/local creation target, carried the
  project/default-placement policy into the new commander's prompt, and made no
  section/pin/move calls. The whole project's existing section was preserved.
- Explicit section: used the verified project/worktree target and moved only
  the two new task IDs to the section returned by the requested creation; no
  project move or unrelated-task change was proposed.
- Missing project: surfaced the missing saved-project binding without creating
  projectless tasks, using an unrelated project, or inventing a section fallback.

All three met these placement-specific checks in simulation. Runtime IDs and
unobserved placement remained unresolved rather than being reported as success.
No real sidebar creation or reorganization was part of this regression run;
this does not establish live task delivery or automatic resumption.

## Version 0.1.0: independent behavioral probes

Eight raw cases were initially exercised in two separate agent contexts. This
was exploratory batching, not eight fully independent conversations. Three
targeted single-case probes then used fresh contexts: per-artifact language,
worker mode, and pending sidebar creation. Evaluators received the skill and raw
scenario inputs, not the evaluation rubric or suggested answers. The integrator
read the resulting responses and intended calls.

Observed decision boundaries included:

- Chinese planning stayed in Chinese and did not create files or tasks.
- An English README request did not change the Chinese language of conversation
  and team records; the fresh probe kept unknown product requirements unresolved.
- Missing sidebar tools were disclosed without invoking native subagents as a
  silent substitute.
- Pending creation IDs were not used as thread addresses; defaults/worktree
  selection were preserved, and the fresh probe respected the supplied wait cap.
- A stale task/attempt report did not authorize acceptance, redispatch, or public
  deployment.
- Worker mode stayed within the assigned document scope rather than repeating
  the project interview or recruiting a team.
- A small production UI change was planned as a narrow solo change, not a team
  or architecture expansion.

One case performed real filesystem work in a disposable fixture: it appended a
Chinese Commander section and created a Chinese project record. The original
English instruction bytes were independently checked and preserved. Only the
two authorized files existed afterward; a subsequent helper preview reported
both as unchanged. No live project was used.

Review prompted two coordination clarifications: a prematurely opened dependent
worker gets a setup-only assignment and stops on its missing dependency; a
native wait's default duration must not override the caller's blocking cap.
The pending-creation fresh probe used those clarified instructions.

These are reviewed samples of decisions, not a numerical success-rate estimate
or end-to-end agent execution. The probes did not execute the full dependency
resume/attempt-rollover or missing-dispatch-record recovery sequence. Artifact
creation, message delivery, identity recovery, and resumption still need real
host tests before unattended use. Raw local probe outputs are not distributed.

## Not established

- Live sidebar creation and callback delivery for this skill version.
- Reliable wake-up after app shutdown, quota exhaustion, or interruption.
- Exactly-once delivery, crash-safe transactions, or concurrent record writers.
- Lower token cost, faster completion, or universally improved output quality.
- Windows/Linux execution testing or exhaustive support for other languages.

See [the evaluation procedure](tests/behavioral-evaluation.md) for the distinction
between file-operation tests and agent/runtime validation.
