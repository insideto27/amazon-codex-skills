# Attribution and design provenance

Codex Commander is independently authored. Its interview approach was informed
by Matt Pocock's MIT-licensed [skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)
repository, reviewed at commit
`6654f6b60cd9d5be8b54c6fafe44346dabeb3b76`.

Relevant upstream work includes `grill-me`/`grilling`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`,
`domain-modeling`, and `code-review`. We acknowledge Matt Pocock's work; this
package is not an unmodified copy of those skills and does not require them.

Our changes include a delivery-bounded interview stopping rule, independent
engineering-depth/team-size decisions, capability-checked cross-thread
coordination for sidebar agents, completion/acceptance separation, localized
project records, and a safe local record bootstrap helper. The original upstream
license is retained in
[licenses/mattpocock-skills-MIT.txt](licenses/mattpocock-skills-MIT.txt).

The restraint principles were also informed by
[Google's code-review guidance](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html),
[Martin Fowler's YAGNI discussion](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html), and
[Anthropic's Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents).
